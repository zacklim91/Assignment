   <div class="accordion">
       <p class="title">1. What is this programme about?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
       <p>The ‘Let’s Get Our Seniors Vaccinated’ programme aims to encourage individuals (“referrer”) aged 17
         years and over to refer unvaccinated seniors aged 60 years and over for COVID-19 vaccination and
         support them in their vaccination journey. With vaccination, seniors will be able to better protect
         themselves and their loved ones. Referrers are encouraged to support seniors by explaining the importance
         and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and assist them to have their concerns addressed by doctors. Referrers
         are required to accompany the senior for their vaccination and are encouraged to care and support them
         after each dose.
<br><br>
        As a token of appreciation for the time and effort taken to provide care and support for the senior,
        the referrer will be given $30 HPB eVouchers, which will be credited in the referrer’s Healthy 365 account,
        for each successful referral.

       <p class="title">8. Who will receive the token of appreciation?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>

         <br>
         a.Referrer and referred seniors are both eligible for the programme (refer to Question 3 for eligibility criteria).
         <br>

       </p>
   </div>
   <div class="accordion">
       <p class="title">9. I received an SMS informing me that I am not eligible or not able to continue participation in the programme, even though I accompanied the senior for his/her first vaccination dose and completed the registration process. Why?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
       <p>Referrers may be rejected from the programme due to one of the following reasons:
         <br>
         a.Referrer did not successfully pre-register prior to the senior receiving his/her first dose of vaccination.
         <br>
         b.Senior is below 60 years old.
         <br>
         c.Referrer has successfully referred 10 seniors prior (maximum number of referrals per person reached).
         <br>
         d.Senior’s vaccination status could not be determined despite HPB’s best efforts due to incorrect information provided or otherwise.
         <br>
         e.Senior was already referred by another individual prior.
         <br>
         f.Senior did not receive both doses of their vaccination at the selected Vaccination Centres.
       </p>
   </div>
   <div class="accordion">
       <p class="title">10. I am unable to accompany senior to the Vaccination Centre for his/her first dose. Can I nominate my friend / family member to accompany senior instead?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
       <p>It is important that seniors receive their COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible. If you are not able to accompany senior for their vaccination, you may request that someone else accompany the senior. However, you will not be eligible for the token of appreciation.
        <br><br>
        We appreciate your effort in encouraging the senior to sign up for the COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves and their loved ones.
       </p>
   </div>
   <div class="accordion">
       <p class="title">11. Can an individual who was previously diagnosed with COVID-19 be vaccinated?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
       <p>Individuals who have had an earlier COVID-19 infection, and have recovered, are recommended to receive a single dose of vaccine no earlier than 3 months after the date of their diagnosis if they had not already completed vaccination previously. There is evidence that a single dose would further boost their immunity against COVID-19. If you are unsure, check with the senior’s doctor.
       </p>
   </div>
   <div class="accordion">
       <p class="title">12. The senior I referred was previously diagnosed with COVID-19, and hence is unable to receive 2 doses of the vaccine. Will I be able to receive the token of appreciation?</p>
       <span class="show">+</span>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
       <p>In this case, if the senior receives a single dose of vaccine no earlier than 3 months after the date of their diagnosis, he/she may be classified as “fully vaccinated”.
         <br><br>
         As such, you will be eligible for the token of appreciation once senior has been fully vaccinated and all of the following criteria is met:
         <br>
         a.Referrer and referred seniors are both eligible for the programme (refer to Question 3 for eligibility criteria)
         <br>
