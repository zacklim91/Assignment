            REFER A SENIOR FOR VACCINATION AND BE REWARDED.</h2>
          <p class="p1">It is important that seniors get vaccinated against COVID-19 as
            they are the most vulnerable
            group and are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill, if infected.
            Taking the COVID-19 vaccine helps seniors to protect themselves and
            their loved ones.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="p1">
            Some seniors are hesitant about vaccination
            because they may not be familiar with the
            importance and benefits of vaccination or
            have concerns about receiving vaccination.
            Let’s encourage our seniors to be vaccinated and provide the support they need.</p>

          <h2 class="hd22">Refer our seniors for COVID-19 vaccination today.</h2>
          <p class="p2">For every successful referral of an unvaccinated senior aged 60
            years and over, $30 HPB eVouchers will be given to the referrer as a token of
            appreciation once HPB has verified that the referred senior has completed both
            doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
